# FYP Project in Heart Disease Classification
FYP Project (Machine Learning Algorithm in data classification)

Explore the world of machine learning in healthcare with our project focusing on classifying heart disease data. We compare various algorithms to find the most effective model. Interact with the results through a user-friendly web application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

#### 1. Dataset
I am going to do investigations into heart-related data classification which may help researchers in the domain of cardiovascular healthcare. A lot of heart disease dataset can be found in any resources including UCI, PHP, BIDMC CHF dataset, and PTB Diagnostic ECG datasets.  
Dataset: [Mendeley Heart Disease Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wmhctcrt5v/1) (Used in this project)  
  
#### 2. Machine Learning Algorithms
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine
* K-Nearest Neighbour
* Naiye bayes
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
